# Aadi's Odyssey
Aadi’s Odyssey is an interactive narrative experience that tells the story of a man named Aadi, his wife Gita and his daughter Aahana. Set in the 1800’s, the game is a fictionalized tale about how some of the first Indian indentured sugarcane labourers came to South Africa, on the ship the Belvedere, which arrived at the British colony of Natal on the 26th of November 1860.
